0.20:
    - Win32 signing problem finally resolved for real, using
      binmode() only when the file passes -B.

0.19:
    - oops. don't ask.

0.18:
    - Win32 signing of binary files was broken.
      (Reported by Jos Boumans)

0.17:
    - Signing used to complain manifest mismatch if SIGNATURE
      is lacking.  Fixed. (Reported by Iain Truskett)
    - Bail out gracefully when signing fails, instead of
      crippling the old SIGNATURE.
    - Lifted documentation about MANIFEST.SKIP from Test::Signature,
      courtesy of Iain Truskett.

0.16:
    - Adds AUTHORS file.
    - Added connectivity probing before testing.
    - Print a helpful success message after signing.
    - Don't cripple old SIGNATURE file on failed signing.
    - Skip the ambiguous 'optional' Makefile.PL probing for
      Crypt::OpenPGP if gnupg is already there.

0.15:
    - Backported to earlier ExtUtils::MakeMaker by simulating the
      default MANIFEST.SKIP behaviour during verification.
      (Reported by chromatic)

0.14:
    - GnuPG on Linux isn't happy with an environment without /dev/tty
      during smoke testing.  Fixed. (Reported by logicalchaos.org)

0.13:
    - Fix (again!) the pre-1.0.7 command line bug caused by a typo,
      as reported by the excellent CPAN Smokers.

0.12:
    - Supports automatic key retrieval, implemented in Crypt::OpenPGP
      version 1.02, as suggested by Benjamin Trott.

    - Fixed the default cipher from MD5 back to SHA1.

0.11:
    - Reported by chromatic: GnuPG before 1.0.7 does not even have
      the --auto-key-retrieve option, but performs it by default.

0.10:
    - Fixed a problem that prevents earlier GnuPGs from fetching
      public keys via --keyserver-option=auto-key-retrieve.

0.09:
    - Reworked the t/0-signature.t sample in the POD to not depend
      on Test::More, for backward compatibility's sake.

    - Documented the package variables so they become part of APIs.

    - Mention Test::Signature in POD, for people who wants to play
      with Advanced Testing Technologies. :)

    - Alternative (non-SHA1) ciphers in SIGNATUREs are now recognized.
      Added a new return value, CIPHER_UNKNOWN.

0.08:
    - Incoporated a suggestion from Tels: undefining the $KeyServer
      package variable should disable automatic key-fetching.

    - The t/0-signature.t test, suggested by Iain Truskett, is added.
      It's a not much use against truly malicious attackers (because
      t/0-signature.t could be modified to simply report 'ok'), but
      does protect against accidental mistakes.

0.07:
    - Fixed the signature.  Nice test case, isn't it? ;)
      (First repoted by Iain Truskett)

0.06:
    - Constants are now exported properly. (Iain Truskett)
    - bin/cpansign now "guesses" the right behaviour depend on whether
      SIGNATURE exists or not. (Arthur Bergman)
    - We now call gpg with automatic key retrieval from pgp.mit.edu.
    - Documentation fixes.

0.05:
    - Fix typos.
    - Checking for cases that neither gpg nor Crypt::OpenPGP is available.
    - Explicit "cpansign sign" didn't work.
    - New shorthand: "cpansign -v", "cpansign -s" and "cpansign -h".

0.04:
    - Text::Diff and diff support.
    - Ask before overwriting SIGNATURE, as suggested by Benjamin Goldberg.
    - Basic documentations is finally there.

0.03:
    - Added boilerplate text before SIGNATURE to explain what's it about.
    - Crypt::OpenPGP signature didn't work.

0.02:

    - Fix typo in manpages.
    - Distname changed from ExtUtils-Signature to Module-Signature.

0.01:

    - First proof-of-concept release.
