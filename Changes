0.11:
    - Reported by chromatic: GnuPG before 1.0.7 does not even have
      the --auto-key-retrieve option, but performs it by default.

0.10:
    - Fixed a problem that prevents earlier GnuPGs from fetching
      public keys via --keyserver-option=auto-key-retrieve.

0.09:
    - Reworked the t/0-signature.t sample in the POD to not depend
      on Test::More, for backward compatibility's sake.

    - Documented the package variables so they become part of APIs.

    - Mention Test::Signature in POD, for people who wants to play
      with Advanced Testing Technologies. :)

    - Alternative (non-SHA1) ciphers in SIGNATUREs are now recognized.
      Added a new return value, CIPHER_UNKNOWN.

0.08:
    - Incoporated a suggestion from Tels: undefining the $KeyServer
      package variable should disable automatic key-fetching.

    - The t/0-signature.t test, suggested by Iain Truskett, is added.
      It's a not much use against truly malicious attackers (because
      t/0-signature.t could be modified to simply report 'ok'), but
      does protect against accidental mistakes.

0.07:
    - Fixed the signature.  Nice test case, isn't it? ;)
      (First repoted by Iain Truskett)

0.06:
    - Constants are now exported properly. (Iain Truskett)
    - bin/cpansign now "guesses" the right behaviour depend on whether
      SIGNATURE exists or not. (Arthur Bergman)
    - We now call gpg with automatic key retrieval from pgp.mit.edu.
    - Documentation fixes.

0.05:
    - Fix typos.
    - Checking for cases that neither gpg nor Crypt::OpenPGP is available.
    - Explicit "cpansign sign" didn't work.
    - New shorthand: "cpansign -v", "cpansign -s" and "cpansign -h".

0.04:
    - Text::Diff and diff support.
    - Ask before overwriting SIGNATURE, as suggested by Benjamin Goldberg.
    - Basic documentations is finally there.

0.03:
    - Added boilerplate text before SIGNATURE to explain what's it about.
    - Crypt::OpenPGP signature didn't work.

0.02:

    - Fix typo in manpages.
    - Distname changed from ExtUtils-Signature to Module-Signature.

0.01:

    - First proof-of-concept release.
